I have created an AWS instance for deep learning

You can access this instance by:
# ssh -i ~/.ssh/classicalmusicnet.pem ubuntu@ec2-54-153-81-3.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com # old instance, dead
ssh -i ~./ssh/classicalmusicnet.pem ubuntu@ec2-54-153-81-3.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com # fresh instance with tf, anaconda, py3, GPU, and other DL goodies


The instance already has the git repository in /home/ubuntu/ClassicalMusicNet/ and python3
I have been using virtualenv at "/home/ubunut/classicalmusic" to install all python requirements

I will email the private key "classicalmusicnet.pen" on request
