Let's define the problem space - 
   * Dataset: 
     * We should find dataset that's classical music (ideally for a specific instrument - i.e., piano)
     * http://piano-midi.de/midicoll.htm
   
   * Framwork: Tensorflow (working off of wavenet implementation)
   * Architecture: Sequence to Sequence generation with Deep RNN and RBM
   
Goal: output unique net-generated music piece of classical piano music.

Optional: I wonder how well will GAN perform on this.


=================



Using:
	[ âœ“ ] TensorFlow	
	[ x ] WaveNet (not using currently beacuse the examples are all text-to-speech)
	[ x ] Music RNN RBM (not using, was written for TF 0.6 and Py 2.7, could not get to work with any installation of TF and dependencies. Moving on)
	[ x ] Magenta - (not using, py 2.7) using Py 2.7 and miniconda. Installation instructions https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta
		Note that Magenta wants you to create its own virtualenv. Install:
			1. curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tensorflow/magenta/master/magenta/tools/magenta-install.sh > /tmp/magenta-install.sh
			2. bash /tmp/magenta-install.sh

Architecture description: Sequence to sequence generation with deep RNN and RBM

Training data: Classical music pieces (e.g. Bach BWV 1-100)

Goal: output unique net-generated music piece of classical style
