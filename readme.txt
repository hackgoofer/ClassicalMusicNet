Using:
	[ âœ“ ] TensorFlow	
	[ x ] WaveNet (not using currently beacuse the examples are all text-to-speech)
	[ x ] Music RNN RBM (not using, was written for TF 0.6 and Py 2.7, could not get to work with any installation of TF and dependencies. Moving on)
	[ ? ] Magenta - using Py 2.7 and miniconda. Installation instructions https://github.com/tensorflow/magenta

Architecture description: Sequence to sequence generation with deep RNN

Training data: Classical music pieces (e.g. Bach BWV 1-100)

Goal: output unique net-generated music piece of classical style
